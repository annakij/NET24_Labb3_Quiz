# Labb3 - Quiz Configurator
This is the third submitted project made through my education as a .NET developer in C#.

The purpose of this project is to build an application to configure quiz packages with usercreated questions, and run quiz rounds. The app should be written in WPF and XAML, and built on Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. MVVM is an architectural design pattern in software development, which facilitates the separation of the development of a graphical user interface from the underlying back-end logic. Since the time for the project is limited, parts of the basic structure were given out through code alongs.
